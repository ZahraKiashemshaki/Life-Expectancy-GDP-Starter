Life Expectancy and GDP Data Visualization Project

This project uses the Life Expectancy and GDP dataset to explore and visualize the relationship between a countryâ€™s GDP and the life expectancy of its citizens. The aim is to uncover trends and patterns that provide insights into how economic factors impact health outcomes across different regions.

Overview

The dataset contains information on life expectancy, GDP, and other socio-economic indicators for various countries over several years. This project involves:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating the data to understand distributions, correlations, and trends.
Data Visualization: Creating various plots to visualize the relationship between life expectancy and GDP.
Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing GDP values, and categorizing countries by income levels.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Using summary statistics and correlation analysis to identify key relationships in the data.
Visualization Techniques: Employing scatter plots, line charts, and bar charts to illustrate the data findings. Interactive visualizations are created using libraries like Plotly and Seaborn for enhanced data exploration.
Key Visualizations

Scatter Plot: Showing the relationship between GDP and life expectancy for different countries.
Line Charts: Illustrating changes in GDP and life expectancy over time for selected countries.
Bar Charts: Comparing average life expectancy across different income groups and regions.
Findings

The visualizations reveal important insights, such as the positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy. Countries with higher GDP tend to have higher life expectancy, although there are notable exceptions influenced by other socio-economic factors.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in uncovering patterns and trends in complex datasets. The visual insights can inform policymakers and researchers about the economic determinants of health.
